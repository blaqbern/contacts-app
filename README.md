# Contacts App

To start the app, run the following commands in the shell of your choice. I use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for convenience, and if you have it installed on your machine, you can run `nvm use` from the root directory to ensure you're using the same version of Node that I am. But this isn't strictly necessary; as long as you're using Node `4.0.0` or above, everything should run fine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blaqbern/contacts-app.git # or git@github.com/blaqbern/contacts-app.git
$ cd contacts-app
$ nvm use # optional
$ yarn # or npm install
$ npm start
```

... now open your browser to http://localhost:8090
